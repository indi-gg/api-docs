Tournament system is a key feature of the Kratos Esports Protocol that enables game developers to host tournaments and incentivize players with rewards.

Upon launching the game for the first time post-protocol implementation, a user's in-game wallet is automatically created, and an initial bonus of 50 KCash is deposited. This currency can be used to participate in tournaments.
