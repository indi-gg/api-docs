The Loyalty protocol rewards dedicated players in the game. These players, who are consistently engaged and participate in quests and events, now receive extra rewards in the form of KCash.

Upon launching the game for the first time post-protocol implementation, a user's in-game wallet is automatically created, and an initial bonus of 50 KCash is deposited.
