# Interstitial Flow

When a user clicks the CTA button, the Interstitial flow is initiated. The Interstitial flow is a webview that provides additional information about the tournament and allows the user to sign up. The game developer will need to implement the webview and provide functional hooks to trigger when the user has signed up for a tournament.
