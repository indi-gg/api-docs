### Technical Concepts

In this documentation guide there are some architectural concepts and terms to get familiar with. For
[details read here](/docs/category/tech-integration).

#### API Key

To get started, game developers will need to connect to the lndiGG Tournament Protocol and receive an API key. The API key will be used to
authenticate API requests and ensure that the game developer has permission to use the protocol.

#### Session Service

Once the game developer has received an API key, they will need to integrate with the session service to initiate user sessions. User
sessions are required to manage the user's participation in tournaments and ensure that their progress is tracked accurately.

#### CTA Button

After the user session has been initiated, the game developer can use the user session to render the CTA button in their game. The CTA
button is the primary means for users to access tournament functionality within the game.

#### Interstitial Flow

When a user clicks the CTA button, the Interstitial flow is initiated. The Interstitial flow is a webview that provides additional
information about the tournament and allows the user to sign up. The game developer will need to implement the webview and provide
functional hooks to trigger when the user has signed up for a tournament.

#### In-Game Events

Finally, the game developer will need to send over in-game events to the lndiGG Tournament Protocol API to ensure that tournament progress
is tracked accurately. In-game events should be sent in a timely manner to ensure that tournament standings are updated in real-time.

#### API Touchpoints

The following is a list of API touchpoints that the game developer will need to use to integrate with the lndiGG Tournament Protocol:

```text
POST /api/connect - Connect to the lndiGG Tournament Protocol and receive an API key.
POST /api/session - Initiate a user session.
GET /api/ctabutton?session_id={session_id} - Retrieve the CTA button HTML to render in the game.
