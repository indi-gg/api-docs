1. All users with a semi-custodial wallet have access to the protocol (Soul bound token): Any user who has a semi-custodial wallet can access the lndiGG ESports Protocol by registering and creating a Soul bound token on the blockchain.
2. Users buy into each tournament with predefined Indi Coin price point (Proof of Participation): To participate in a tournament, users must buy into the tournament with a predefined amount of Indi Coin. This ensures that users have a stake in the tournament and are motivated to perform well.
3. Reward Pool is created per tournament of user Buy-ins: Each tournament has a reward pool that is created based on the buy-ins of the participating users. The more users that participate in a tournament, the larger the reward pool will be.
4. 15% Rake, split equally between IndiGG & the developer from the reward pool: A 15% rake is taken from the reward pool, which is split equally between IndiGG and the game developer.
5. User rewarded via the remaining 85% in the reward pool as follows:
    - a. Direct single user reward on successful win: A direct single user reward is given to the user who wins the tournament.
    - b. Direct Multi user reward on successful win: A direct multi-user reward is given to multiple users who perform well in the tournament.
    - c. Leaderboard ranking rewards: Leaderboard ranking rewards are given to users based on their position on the tournament leaderboard.
6. Rewards are distributed via Smart Contracts on-chain (Proof of Reward): All rewards are distributed via smart contracts on the blockchain, ensuring that the process is transparent and secure. This provides proof of reward for all users who participate in a tournament.
7. Tournament participation & earning are recorded on-chain (Proof of Participation): All tournament participation and earnings are recorded on the blockchain, providing proof of participation for all users.
